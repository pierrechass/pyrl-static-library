# pyrl-static-library
Collection of python "static" functions to perform various (basic) reinforcement learning tasks or algorithms.

This library was originally created for my [Master Thesis](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/sycamore/student-projects/) (not uploaded yet).

The code is of poor quality and is not usable right now but I am working on it (see open Issues).
